Every time you feel like you are making decent progress, the unchanging environment around you reminds you that you aren’t in control of this journey. With no map, no navigation equipment, you only had yourself to reassure you that you are indeed on your way to finding some sort of resources or help. If nothing else, you at least had enough mental fortitude to do that.

To pass the time, your eyes scan the path for signs of footsteps–either friendly or unfriendly. Disconcertingly, you find neither.

After a few hours of exploring an endless desert path, you begin to feel weak. Your coughing fits–once rare–are now almost nonstop. In a way to deter the incoming madness from your frail constitution, you start to connect the blood spatters running across your palm for some sort of comfort.

Your vision begins to blur and your body feels immovable. Your face droops first, before your eyelids follow in suit.

Before you lose consciousness, you see in your periphery, the imposing moon that had taunted you earlier today.
