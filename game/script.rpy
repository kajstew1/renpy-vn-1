Smoke billows out of the crashed spacecraft. You, the sole survivor, wake up in a haze. Your blurry eyes, disoriented from the sharp impact, try to make sense of the destruction in front of you. Debris is scattered across the broken grass turf, like a distorted kaleidoscope.

The ship was supposed to have been indestructible. No one had been chasing you. The sensors were all clear. So what did the ship hit? And what were the odds that the generator would have been the target of the impact? None of this made sense.

An involuntary coughing fit brought about from the dark smoke around you made you come back to your senses. You look at your hand and are horrified to see tiny droplets of blood sprinkled all over your palm.

Your movements were painfully slow, but you were able to maneuver around the wrecked ship to the ground below. The grass was a welcome change in texture, soft and inviting unlike the harsh and distorted floor of the ship.

You had no idea where you crash landed. As the captain you had to make a quick decision when the ship had been hit, either take your chance on the neighboring moon or divert towards the nearest planet. It had seemed at the time that a planet would have more resources and potentially a civilization available, but after reviewing the landscape, you weren’t sure.

While there was a blue sky and green grass, that’s where the comparisons ended between your home planet and the environment surrounding you. In the far distance welcomed a skyline of blooming mushrooms. Using your best estimation, they had to have been as tall and thick as the redwoods you had been accustomed to seeing when you were a child.

Neon-colored flying dinosaur-looking creatures dotted the sky above. As they circled the crash site, they let out a screech. You recoiled, holding your hands protectively against your ears.

Your heart starts to race when you realized that you were well and truly alone in this treacherous landscape. The small crew that had opted to not use the escape pods and stayed with you had all lost oxygen and died before the ship entered the planet’s atmosphere.

You truly didn’t know where to start. The communication system on the ship had shorted and broke before you could alert the nearest space station and you knew no one on this planet.

You had trekked up the worn, uneven path in front of you. It was disconcerting as it appeared as though it hadn’t been used in half of a century. But seeming as though you had no other option, you continued onward, desperately hoping for a sign of civilization or at least another living being.

You wonder what kinds of lifeforms live on this planet. This had been your first time in this galaxy–and of course it had ended terribly. You had just wanted to be a space explorer like those you had grown to admire, but like most dreams, it was not what it appeared.

You are exhausted from your half a day journey through the unending fields of green. You clutch onto your wounded stomach, while the bleeding had blessedly stopped, you still felt a tremendous amount of pain. If you didn’t get help by tomorrow, you feared you may meet your demise on a deserted planet. Your corpse feeding the humongous alien creatures that skulked around you in the distance.
